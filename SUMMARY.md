# COVID-19 Global Impact Analysis – Key Insights

## 1. Spread Dynamics (Time Series)
- Top impacted countries (by total cases) show distinct waves of infection and mortality.
- Deaths per 100k closely follow case surges, with a lag of 2–4 weeks.
- Some countries exhibit faster recovery rates, likely linked to early interventions and healthcare capacity.

## 2. Deaths vs Vaccination
- Countries with higher vaccination rates per capita generally show lower deaths per 100k in recent periods.
- Outliers exist, often due to late vaccine rollouts or high-risk populations.
- Vaccine equity remains a challenge, with some high-death countries having lower vaccination coverage.

## 3. Policy Response vs Outcomes
- Stringency index increases (lockdowns, mask mandates) often precede or coincide with reductions in new cases/deaths.
- Countries that implemented strong policies early saw faster declines in case rates.
- The relationship is not perfect—other factors (healthcare, population density, compliance) also play a role.

## 4. Correlation Analysis
- Strong positive correlation between confirmed cases and deaths per 100k.
- Negative correlation between vaccination rates and deaths per 100k.
- Stringency index correlates with reduction in new cases, but with diminishing returns at very high levels.

## 5. Public Health Insights
- Early, strong policy interventions are associated with better outcomes.
- High vaccination coverage is critical for reducing mortality.
- Ongoing monitoring and adaptive policy are needed for future waves.
